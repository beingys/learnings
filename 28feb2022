Encapsulation:-
* Encapsulation in java is a mechanism of wrapping the data(variable) & code acting on data(methods) togeather as single unit.
* In Encapsulation, the variales of a class will be hidden from other classes & can be accessed only through mode of current class. Therfore, it is also known as data hiding.
*Example-

public class runClass{
EncapTest encap = new EncapTest();
encap.setName("James");
encap.SetAge("20");
System.out.println("Name:" + encap.getName() + "Age:" + encap.getAge());
}
